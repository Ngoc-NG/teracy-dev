Introduction
============

Welcome to ``teracy-dev`` - get development fun!

We, Teraciers, believe that development experience is really important. That's why we care and make
sure our development environment must be consistent, smooth, and easy to setup. We don't have to
spend tons of time for installing tons of development packages one by one, we want that setup
process must be automated.

That's why this ``teracy-dev`` repository was created for working at Teracy with ease and fun.
We're going to use ``virtualbox`` for running isolated virtual machines, ``chef`` and ``vagrant``
for installing and configuring any necessary packages automatically.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Required:

    + ``virtualbox``
    + ``vagrant``

- Optional:

    + ``git``

**Windows Notes**:

- You MUST install ``git`` to use ``Git Bash`` and from now on we will call it ``terminal window``.

- You MUST ALWAYS run ``virtualbox`` and ``Git Bash`` as **administrator** to make symlinks
  (of virtualenv) work as expected.
