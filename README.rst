teracy-dev
==========

The only truly universal software development platform for all!


``teracy-dev`` is created to set up a universal development platform which has the same development
workflow on Mac, Linux and Windows with good developer experience and productivity in mind. 

We leverage Docker workflow for our software development and we use ``vagrant``, ``virtualbox``, and
``chef`` to install and configure any necessary packages.

By using this approach, we can work in a consistent development environment and workflow.
We do not have to install tons of development stuff on the host machine **manually** to get started.


Usage
-----

- ``$ vagrant up`` to boot the VM

- ``$ vagrant ssh`` to access the VM via SSH
