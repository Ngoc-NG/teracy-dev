teracy-dev
==========

The only truly universal productive software development platform for all!


``teracy-dev`` is created to set up a universal development platform which has the same development
workflow on Mac, Linux and Windows with good developer experience and productivity in mind. 

We leverage Docker workflow for our software development and we use ``vagrant``, ``virtualbox``, and
``chef`` to install and configure any necessary packages.

By using this approach, we can work in a consistent development environment and workflow.
We do not have to install tons of development stuff on the host machine **manually** to get started.


Features
--------

- fully automated managed servers on your local machine (by leveraging ``vagrant` + `chef``
  provisioner). This saves you a lot of money to work on many virtual private servers (VPS) on
  your local machine before deploying on the production servers.
- works universally the same on Windows, Linux and Mac
- higher performance and productivity gain than default vagrant settings
- support different configuration management tools as provisioners
- default set up with easy customization without any limitation
